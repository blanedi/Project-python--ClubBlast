Project : ClubBlast Hertie engine

Objective:
Hertie has an active social and academic community, with dozens of student clubs and regular compelling events. 
Currently, events are communicated to the student body through email. 
This requires students to read through long lists of information in multiple locations to identify events they would enjoy.
It can be difficult for busy students (and faculty) to keep track of! Our project will allow Hertie community members to identify upcoming club events of significance by entering their interests. 
It will return suggestions of forthcoming club events based on user input, with additional information about the event so the user can make an informed decision on how best to spend their time.
